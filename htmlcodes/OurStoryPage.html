                            5 Seconds of Summer began in 2011 when Luke Hemmings, Michael Clifford, and Calum Hood, who all
                            attended Norwest Christian College, started posting videos of themselves performing covers of popular
                            songs together on Luke's YouTube channel. Luke's first video, a cover of Mike Posner's *Please Don't Go*, 
                            was posted on the 3rd February in 2011. Their cover of Chris Brown's *Next To You* received over 600,000 hits. 
                            In December 2011, they were joined by drummer Ashton Irwin, and the four-man lineup was completed.

                            They rose to international fame while touring with One Direction on their Take Me Home Tour. 
                            They have since released four studio albums and headlined three world tours.

                            In early 2014, the band released *She Looks So Perfect* as their debut single, which topped the charts 
                            in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Their self-titled debut album was released 
                            in June 2014, peaking at number one in 11 countries, and was followed by a live album titled *LiveSOS*. 
                            They went on their first headlining tour *Rock Out With Your Socks Out Tour* to support the album.

                            8 countries. It was followed by a live documentary DVD titled *How Did We End Up Here*. They went on the 
                            *Sounds Live Feels Live Tour* to support the album. In December 2016, the band announced the release of 
                            their B-sides and rarities under the title *This Is Everything We Ever Said* to celebrate their band's

                            The band released their third album *Youngblood* on 15 June 2018. It became their third number one album 
                            in their home country. In the US, 5 Seconds of Summer became the first Australian act to achieve three 
                            chart-toppers on the Billboard 200 chart. They also became the first band (not vocal) to have their first 
                            three full-length albums debut at the top in the US. They embarked on the *Meet You There Tour* to support 
                            the album.
